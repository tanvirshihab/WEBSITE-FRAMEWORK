        <h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</h2>

           <p>What's a computer? A few years ago, Apple infamously pushed us to embrace serious work on iPads. Now, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4 ($1,799.99) takes the portable productivity concept even further with new software that simplifies multitasking. But the company's latest large-screen foldable also boasts a slightly wider screen, a more durable design, better camera hardware, and stronger 5G support than its predecessor, the Z Fold 3.</p>
           <h5 class="bold">Problem Solve</h5>
           <p>All those refinements make for a phone we enthusiastically recommend, despite its high price. And that’s a good thing, because Samsung remains alone in its pursuit of big-screen foldables, at least in the US. Any foldable devices from Apple or Google are still just rumors, and Motorola's new Razr competes more with the smaller Galaxy Z Flip 4 instead.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5 class="bold">Who It's For</h5>
           <p>If your needs are relatively simple and your targeted spend is much closer to $500 than $1,000, you can’t beat what this phone has to offer. True budget phone usually include some sort of compromise, so the best budget systems minimize them as much as possible, and the shortcomings here aren't dealbreakers. Phone costs have risen steadily in the past couple years, so if a bargain is your main concern and you just need a Mobile for light everyday use cases, look no further.</p>
           <h5 class="bold">Future Expaction
</h5>
           <p>At 6.11 by 2.64 by 0.62 inches (HWD) and 9.28 ounces, the Z Fold 4 is bulkier than other flagship phones, but that's just the price you pay for power right now and it still fits comfortably into my hand in the closed position. For reference, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max (6.3 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches, 8.5 ounces) and the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (6.4 by 3.1 by 0.4 inches, 8.1 ounces) are both lighter and slimmer.</p>

           <p>The iPhone 14 is Apple's meat-and-potatoes smartphone, offering a dependable everyday experience with basics such as an attractive display, excellent build quality, all-day battery life, smooth performance, and competent cameras starting at $799. While it also has some of the pricier iPhone 14 Pro's features such as Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite, it skips out on the most compelling new experiences offered by that line, including an always-on display, Dynamic Island, and A16 Bionic processor.</p>
           <h5 class="bold">Problem Solve</h5>
           <p>t's a supremely comfortable size and weight that should suit most people well.There's no question that the iPhone 14 will serve most people well, but it feels a little farther behind Apple's top-shelf Pro line than previous models have. So while the iPhone 14 Pro Max ($1,099) earns our Editors' Choice award, the iPhone 14 is still an excellent, safe choice if you're looking to save some money.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5 class="bold">Who It's For </h5>
           <p>The iPhone 14 carries over nearly all its external DNA from last year's iPhone 13, which itself was very much the same as the 2020 iPhone 12. Apple tends to settle on design choices and stick with them for a while (which is why its laptops have looked more or less the same for nearly a decade). While we appreciate that this perhaps helps Apple save on product development costs, it's hard to convince people to buy a new thing that looks exactly like the old thing.</h5>
            <h5 class="bold">Future Expaction</h5>
           <p>The iPhone 14 measures 5.78 by 2.82 by 0.31 inches (HWD) and weighs 6.07 ounces, which is 0.01 inches thicker and 0.07 ounces lighter than the iPhone 13. It's a supremely comfortable size and weight that should suit most people well. The closest competing phones in terms of quality, cost, and features are the Google Pixel 6 .</p>

           <p>For years, Motorola’s G-series handsets topped our list of the best affordable phones, but its 2021 lineup fell short of expectations, while competing models from Samsung and TCL caught up. The first entry in the company's 2022 lineup, the Moto G Power sets Motorola back on track. The fast and affordable Moto G Power easily lasts for two days between charges and sports a display with a 90Hz refresh rate starting at $199.99. </p>
           <h5 class="bold">Problem Solve</h5>
           <p>The Moto G Power is a handful at 6.6 by 3.0 by 0.4 inches (HWD) and 7.2 ounces. It distributes its weight well across its plastic chassis, however. Additionally, the phone's textured matte black back feels good in the hand, helps with grip, and doesn’t show off fingerprints or scratches as precise of a touch as in-display or side-mounted sensors and which is 0.01 inches thicker and 0.07 ounces lighter </p>

        <span>
          <h5 class="bold">Who It's For</h5>
           <p>A headphone jack sits on the top edge of the phone, while the bottom edge houses a USB-C charging port and speaker. A combo SIM and microSD slot is the only port on the left, while a volume rocker and textured power button are on the right. The buttons are easy to identify by touch, but you might have trouble reaching them if you have small hands.</h5>
            <h5 class="bold">Future Expaction</h5>
           <p>On the back of the G Power, a thin module for the camera sensors sits in the upper left corner. And while the power button on last year’s G Power doubled as a fingerprint sensor, that has been moved to the back of the phone here; it works quickly and accurately, and doesn’t require . </p>

        <h2>Google Pixel 6</h2>

        <span>
          <h5 class="bold">Global story related product</h5>
           <p>CGoogle's Pixel 6 is a sophisticated midrange phone that replaces the good, but uninspired Pixel 5. It takes a spot between the company's high-end flagship, the Pixel 6 Pro ($899), and the more affordable Pixel 5a With 5G ($449), and offers quite an impressive feature-to-value ratio for $599. With its combination of strong camera performance, long battery life, and unbeatable Android software, the Pixel 6 easily bests the competition and replaces the Pixel 5a as our Editors' Choice winner for midrange phones.</p>
           <h5 class="bold">Problem Solve</h5>
           <p>The Pixel 6's combination of curved edges and severe right angles makes the phone seem like it would be right at home in Tomorrowland. It maintains many of the influences that underscore Google’s design language, but an element of mid-century futurism is also thrown into the mix. We like the look, but it probably won’t appeal to everyone.At 6.2 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 7.3 ounces, the Pixel 6 is more manageable than the bigger Pro model (6.5 by 3.0 by 0.4 inches, 7.4 ounces). You can wrap your hand around the phone and its buttons are easy to reach.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5 class="bold">Who It's For</h5>
           <p>Google sells the Pixel 6 in three different colors, including Kinda Coral, Sorta Seafoam, and Stormy Black. The Kinda Coral version is a blend of pastel red and pink. Sorta Seafoam is a duo of blue and green. Stormy Black is the most subdued of the trio, with a monochromatic black panel. All three phones have matte black rails. We tested the Sorta Seafoam model.</h5>
            <h5 class="bold">Future Expaction</h5>
           <p>A flat, 6.4-inch, 90Hz OLED panel dominates the front of the phone. The bezels are thin, but the flat panel makes them more noticeable than on the Pixel 6 Pro. Resolution clocks in at 2,400 by 1,080 pixels, which equates to a density of 411 pixels per inch (PPI). Colors are lush but accurate, with deep blacks. The display is bright enough to see in direct sunlight and viewing angles are solid.</p>

          <h5 class="bold">Global story related product</h5>
           <p>The Galaxy A32 5G is a handsome phone. It has a plastic back panel and chassis, but it doesn't look like the cheap budget phones of yesteryear. In the US, the phone has a glossy gray finish. Unfortunately, it quickly collected fingerprints and hairline scratches in testing.The phone measures 6.5 by 3.0 by 0.4 inches and weighs 7 ounces. </p>
           <h5 class="bold">Problem Solve</h5>
           <p>. That’s a typical weight for a handset with a 6.5-inch display, but the Galaxy A32 5G’s slippery finish makes it more susceptible to accidental drops than models with textured backs. The phone slid out of my hands on a few occasions while I was testing it. Fortunately, its plastic body and Gorilla Glass 5 display withstood these fumbles. </p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5 class="bold">Who It's For</h5>
           <p>The front of the Galaxy A32 5G is dominated by a 6.5-inch LCD with a teardrop notch and slight bezels. The resolution clocks in at 1,600 by 720 pixels, for 270 pixels per inch. The display is bright and vivid, and you’ll be hard-pressed to notice any pixelation without close examination. That said, it doesn’t compare with the less-expensive OnePlus Nord N200 5G's 6.49-inch, 2,400-by-1,080-pixel 90Hz display.</h5>
            <h5 class="bold">Future Expaction</h5>
           <p>Instead of the protruding camera module you see on most Samsung phones, the Galaxy A32 5G has three discrete sensor bumps vertically stacked in the upper left corner of the back panel. To their right is another sensor that’s flush with the phone, along with the flash. . The phone Samsung logo and microscopic regulatory information are located on the bottom third of the back panel.</p>

          <h5 class="bold">Global story related product</h5>
           <p>Unihertz makes a bold move with its curvy new phone, a reinterpretation of a classic design that old-school smartphone fans definitely still carry a torch for. The Titan Pocket may leave you with some Qs as to why the company is working off such an old playbook, but there's a niche group of keyboard fans who will find this to be a real pearl of a gadget.</p>
           <h5 class="bold">Problem Solve</h5>
           <p>QWERTY-keyboarded phones used to hold a huge place in the market, and in people's hearts. Before touchscreens became (literally) huge, physical keyboards were the best way to input data, and they still have their fans. For one thing, you can use physical keys unseen, typing only by feel and muscle memory in a way you can't with a virtual keyboard.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5 class="bold">Who It's For</h5>
           <p>Unihertz specializes in quirky phone designs, like the tiny Jelly 2. Last year, it rolled out the Titan, a QWERTY phone that many people found unusably large: It's 3.66 inches wide and weighs 10 ounces. For one thing The Titan Pocket, on the other hand, is very close to the size of 2014's BlackBerry Classic, though it's still larger than the legendary BlackBerry Bold.

          </h5>
            <h5 class="bold">Future Expaction</h5>
           <p>The company uses Kickstarter(Opens in a new window) as a presale platform, but this isn't a crowdsourced phone. Kickstarter is just how Unihertz drums up interest, as it doesn't have much of a marketing budget. True budget phone usually include. The phone will cost $299 after the presale period, but for now you can get it at a (frequently shifting) discount.</p>
