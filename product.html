        <h2>Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14</h2>
        <h5>Best Budget Laptop, Augusr 7, 2022</h5>

          <h5>Why We Picked It</h5>
           <p>Is a nicely built, fast performing, well-equipped laptop for way under $1,000 too much to ask for? The Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 firmly answers, offering that and more for around just $520. For that low price, it delivers snappy speeds, USB-C ports, a comfortable keyboard, and even a fingerprint scanner, all in a compact body with good battery life. There are some compromises—chiefly a lackluster display and speakers—but it’s still a tremendous value overall.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>We wish this product more cost effective</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>Who It's For</h5>
           <p>If your needs are relatively simple and your targeted spend is much closer to $500 than $1,000, you can’t beat what this laptop has to offer. True budget laptops usually include some sort of compromise, so the best budget systems minimize them as much as possible, and the shortcomings here aren't dealbreakers. PC costs have risen steadily in the past couple years, so if a bargain is your main concern and you just need a laptop for light everyday use cases, look no further.</p>
           <h5>Future sustainability</h5>
           <p>It's a reliable product from the lenovo company & its been useed widely</p>

        <h2>HP Pavilion Plus 14</h2>
        <h5>Best Laptop for Most Buyers, September 15, 2022</h5>
      </header>
      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage2.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Why We Picked It</h5>
           <p>This is, simply put, one of the best deals for a Windows laptop right now. To qualify as the best pick for most shoppers, a laptop needs an affordable starting price, quick parts, premium build quality, and ideally (for those with bigger budgets) room to scale up when ordering. The Pavilion Plus 14 delivers all of those at a sub-$800 starting price, with a thin design, very capable processor choices, and an option to jump up to a high-res, 90Hz OLED display without breaking the bank. Even our review configuration—which opted for the OLED screen, 1TB SSD, and potent Core i7 H-Series CPU upgrades—rings up at a reasonable $1,279.99. It's a great deal for a well-made and fully featured laptop with minor shortcomings.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>Good array of ports and 5-megapixel webcam</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>Who It's For</h5>
           <p>The average shopper who wants a quick, portable, and low-fuss system doesn't need to look further. It's particularly friendly to those who can extend their budget beyond the low starting price for some of those fast and fancy upgrade options. There are bigger-screen alternatives if that's your priority, but if you’re looking for a light portable laptop for everyday home and office tasks, a fair starting price (with room to configure up), and reliable all-around performance, this is the best value around.</h5>

        <h2>MSI Katana GF66</h2>
        <h5>Best Budget Gaming Laptop, September 30, 2022</h5>
      </header>
      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage3.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Why We Picked It</h5>
           <p>graphics with 6GB of display memory, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The best part? You get all this for $1,200. That price only applies in-store at Micro Center, but even if you spend up to $200 more online, it's still reasonable. Though we wish the MSI Katana GF66 had a more vivid screen, a little more CPU muscle, and longer battery life, none of those flaws stops it from being a respectable budget gaming laptop. As for cooling, the Katana isn't a silent runner by any means, but its fans aren't distracting, and its chassis has no hotspots where you'd normally put your fingers.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>Display isn't overly bright or colorful</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>Who It's For</h5>
           <p>The Katana GF66 is ideally suited for people who want the best combination of price and graphics horsepower. It essentially offers GeForce RTX 3060 graphics at an RTX 3050 Ti (or even regular RTX 3050) price, and that GPU helps it make the most of its 144Hz display. That's a rare achievement for a laptop in this price class, which makes it a no-brainer as our top pick for budget gaming laptops.</h5>

        <h2>MSI CreatorPro X17</h2>
        <h5>Best Workstation Laptop, September 30, 2022</h5>

      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage4.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Why We Picked It</h5>
           <p>Carrying independent software vendor (ISV) certifications for specialized design, CGI, and scientific apps, the CreatorPro X17 is our Editors' Choice winner for laptop workstations. There's a lot of competition in this category, but the CreatorPro X17 is the clear choice on a performance basis, leading a competitive category in making light work of our benchmark tests. It's certainly not the lightest option, if you are prioritizing mobility, at 6.82 pounds, but it more than makes up for that in raw power (our review configuration packs an Intel Core i9-12900HX CPU and an Nvidia RTX A5500 GPU). It will, unsurprisingly, cost you a pretty penny, but that's par for the course in the world of high-end workstations.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>Massive design limits portability</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>Who It's For</h5>
           <p>Workstation users who seek a big screen and even bigger power. The 17-inch 4K display is a treat for the eyes, and if you need ISV certifications and raw muscle to power through demanding data or graphics applications, this is your best bet. The upgrade ceiling is very high, it's bursting with useful ports, and it will make mincemeat of the demanding tasks you throw its way.</h5>

        <h2>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE</h2>
        <h5>Best Workstation Laptop, October 15, 2022</h5>

      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage5.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Why We Picked It</h5>
           <p>The two main downsides to the Triton 300 SE are its 14-inch screen that may be tight for some gamers, and a 512GB SSD, which is potentially cramped for large game libraries. Unless you can't overcome these drawbacks, the Triton 300 SE is definitely for you, the gamer seeking a laptop at the nexus of affordability and performance.</p>
